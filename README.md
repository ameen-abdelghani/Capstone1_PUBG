First capstone project for Springboard Data Science Track. A data analysis on the hit video game Players Unknown Battlegrounds

Dataset

Players Unknown Battleground is the 2017 video game of the year that began a whole new genre in video games that is currently dominating the market. It is currently the fifth best selling game of all time. The concept is simple, 100 players, optionally in teams, are dropped off on an island with nothing, they must scavenge the map for weapons and equipment with the map size shrinking to a random location, last man or team standing wins.. This genre is called battle royale, and has influences from the hit movie series The Hunger Games and the Japanese film Battle Royale.

Problem

As this genre is very new, and has at the same time swept the world through PUBG and other hits like Fortnite, the overall best strategy to win a match is disputed. Unlike many other game concepts, only 1-4% (depending on team size) of players are actually considered winners. A game such as this takes more into consideration than simply shooting skills; strategy, patience, and positioning are crucially. 

PUBG Corporation is not a Triple A game developer, they are rather small in scale, and despite the game being a large hit, the game lacks basic features and efficiencies you might expect in such a hit game. Key features such as tips, training modes, and tutorials are nonexistent in the game. 

In recent months PUBG has been losing large amounts of playerbase to Fortnite, the current most played game (also of the battle royale genre). Adding features that might support interest in the game would improve player retention and increase player competitiveness. 


Hypothesis

From the Kaggle data I aim to answer questions most players face when playing a match of PUBG. From the data I want to ask the following questions
Do players that get more kills, end up more likely to win a match?
Do players that travel less, end up more likely to win a match?
Where on the map do players end up dying the most? 
Does using a vehicle in a match mean you do worse?
If you were to ask your average player some of these questions, you would find very mixed answers. Peopleâ€™s strategies differ, and they base it off their experiences.
